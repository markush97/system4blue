I am a student at the Technical-University in Vienna and member of a fire-department myself. I am responsible for managing the inventory and keeping track of maintenance and similar stuff and thus had the idea to simplify and automate this tasks.

If you have some other questions about licensing, want a special adoption of my software for myself
